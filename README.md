# OIBSIPtask2NumberGuessingGame
Hello Guys, The Number Guessing Game is 42 lines code which I have written in the JAVA Programming Language. This project has various features such as that we have to guess a number between 1 to 100 in between 5 trials/chances. If we pick the correct number between the 5 chances, then we will win.
